        <p>Couple of months ago I have started a <a href="/tag/topic-price-formation/">series of posts</a>
on price formation in the free market or how and why the free market does (not) work.
Let us deviate from the topic by discussing the proposed alternative to
the "neo-liberal" idea of the globalization and the free trade.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that in the post that follows I will not follow the usual practice of
listing (referencing) the sources. Most of the sources I found while exploring this
topic are extremely questionable as they try to promote ideological agenda
instead of exploring ideas behind them.</p>
<p>Also be warned that text is rather long and the answer is rather obvious. No,
we should not turn to economic nationalism. It is rather bad idea, which works
only for strong nations, which are able to exploit more vulnerable nations.</p>

<h2>What economic nationalism actually is?</h2>
<p>The question is actually surprisingly quite a tough one,
as people who are openly economic nationalists fail to as openly provide
a definition to their ideology. Even if they do try to define it, they seem to
provide conflicting definitions. For example, some economic nationalists
fiercely reject "liberal propaganda" that economic nationalism embraces
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism">protectionism</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, while others admit
the connection between these concepts. This lack of coherency is addressed in
some of the sources, which usually claim that economic nationalism embraces
numerous different economic policies (including the aforementioned ones as well as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Import_substitution_industrialization">import substitution</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy">planned economies</a>), which
could allow their nation to prosper at the expense of the other nations.
Supposedly economic nationalism is different from, and thus much better than,
other economic ideologies, because it embraces thousands of years of experience.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Confused" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2018/price-formation-should-we-turn-to-economic-nationalism.jpg"/></div>
<p>Strangely this experience is not recognized by the other economists, despite of
hundreds years of research. This narrative inspires to make a comparison with folk
medicine. Folk medicine has its long history, but not much of its "achievements"
were confirmed by medical science. So if you really need help, you should turn
to a medical doctor and not to the "experienced" grandma. I guess the same goes,
with some caveats, for the economists.</p>
<h2>Theoretical example</h2>
<p>One of the more decent sources (see
<a href="https://nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2017/03/21/economic-nationalism/">here</a>
though note that this source is far from being truly good - it still promotes
ideological agenda and suffers from typical logical errors)
provides an interesting example using wool and sweaters. The example goes as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>People living in the nation A tend sheep and produce wool, the wool is exported
to the nation B.</li>
<li>People living in the nation B import wool and produce sweaters, which are exported
back to the nation A.</li>
<li>Ruler of the nation A does not like this, hence he imposes taxes on the exported wool
and on the imported sweaters.</li>
<li>The collected tax is reinvested in the nation A by building wool mills. Hence the
nation A prospers!</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Sheep" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2018/sheep-pixabay-cc0.jpg"/></div>
<p>But when you actually try to think about it, it occurs that it is not that
simple. Just think what these steps do to the supply and demand curves.
Most likely the demand curves remain where they are, as everyone still needs a
couple of sweaters in winter. While the supply curve moves significantly to the
left, because the lack of competition at lower prices. Namely the prices for the
locally produced sweaters will grow until they will almost match the prices of the
imported sweaters.</p>
<p>As the supply curve moves to the left, equilibrium point also moves to the left.
This means that less sweaters are sold for higher prices. Hence some people are
no longer able to afford buying sweaters. They will freeze in winter!
What a prosperity!</p>
<p>Another key point to consider is that labor resource is limited (unless free
movement of labor!), hence the wages should grow as industries compete for work
force. The problem is that these two industries are mutually dependent, hence
the competition for the work force between these industries is extremely weak.
Hence the wages will grow slower than prices. Furthermore splitting the
population between the two industries will decrease the supply of both wool
and sweaters, increasing the prices even further.</p>
<p>Yes, these industries could try to attract workers from other industries. But
why should ruler of the nation A apply the economic nationalism only to wool
and sweater industries? The same thing goes on in other industries.</p>
<p>Want another complication? Think what nation B does in response. They could
do something similar in other industry. But as I am already tired of writing
about this nonsense, let me choose the simplest option. This means WAR!
BUY our sweaters or DIE!</p>
<p>Yay stable economy! Yay unstable struggle for power!</p>
<p>No single individual can be self-sustaining and live in prosperity. We need
other people to do what we can't do on our own. We need to delegate some
functions to others and to return the favor we must take on some functions
ourselves. We need to cooperate to live peacefully and to prosper.
The same very logic applies at higher scale - no nation can be self-sustaining
and have high standard of living.</p>
<h2>Historical examples</h2>
<p>Here is where the previously mentioned "decent" source fails (see
<a href="https://nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2017/03/21/economic-nationalism/">here</a>)
by becoming heavily biased. This source provides three success stories and forgets
to provide an analysis on hows and whys. The reader is left to delve in other
biased posts on the same blog, which still neglect to mention the dark side
of mercantilism. So while I am not that familiar with the contemporary
example (China), I feel rather familiar with
the history of Venice and the British Empire. I would like to add the Japanese
Empire to the list as well.</p>
<p>Venice gained momentum in 1200s, when they invented ships, which were
technologically superior to the ones used by their competitors. Hence they were
able to gain trade and transportation monopolies, which they used to enrich
their country. The caveat was that they enriched their country at the expense
of the other nations, which had no other choice. As soon as the other nations
gained alternatives (Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gamma), they freed
themselves and the prosperity of Venice declined. Also some nations got
extremely pissed and declared war on Venice. <strong>The lesson is</strong> that Venice
exploited its superior position to extract wealth from the other countries.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="The British Empire" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2018/british-empire-1920-pixabay-cc0.jpg"/></div>
<p>The British Empire isolated itself by imposing huge tariffs on some of the imported
goods in around 1600s. This raised prices as well as created the need for the
nation to expand. The expansion was necessary so that the country could produce
everything its citizens needed. As a result the British Empire was at one time the
largest country in the world. Also we could attribute
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29">the Great Famine in Ireland of 1840s</a>
(1 million people died, 1 million people immigrated) to the high tariff policy.
At the same time all of the Europe suffered from the potato blight, but it hit
Ireland the hardest, because the food prices in the British Empire were heavily
inflated by the protectionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">Corn laws</a>.
England suffered less as the Corn laws were beneficial for this part of the
Empire. Repealing Corn laws lead to the decrease of the food prices and as a
result it improved the standard of living of the poorer classes. Soon the British
Empire abandoned other policies of economic nationalism and embraced free
trade. <strong>The lesson is</strong> that the British Empire extracted wealth from their
colonies and as soon as an important part of the supply chain collapsed paid
the price with deaths of millions of their own citizens. Another lesson is that
the ones who benefited from economic nationalism were the elite and not the
ordinary people (who are rallied by contemporary economic nationalists).</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Matsumoto Castle" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2018/matsumoto-castle-pixabay-cc0.jpg"/></div>
<p>From 1630s to 1850s Japan isolated itself from the rest of the world banning
almost all foreign trade (with exception of couple of ports, which were open to
ships from several countries). By the end of the isolation period Japanese
people still lived as in 1640s. Japan was lagging behind the Western countries
by 200 years. After the Meiji restoration (which ended the isolation period)
Japan managed to catch up with the rest of the World in less than 50 years.
By the First World War Japan became a major power. <strong>The lesson is</strong> that
self-isolation freezes standard of living of otherwise very capable nation.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>By considering the theoretical and historical examples I have analyzed the core ideas
behind economic nationalism. As far as I can tell economic nationalism stifles
the competition, which leads to an increase in the prices (supply curves shift
to the left). This increase does not contribute to an increase in the standard of
living of the ordinary people, but helps to further enrich the local economic
elite (increasing economic inequality). Furthermore in order for economic
nationalism to work labor force must be
allocated efficiently (so that nothing is wasted). This "efficiency" introduces
additional fragility into the economy - as soon as something fails, the
consequences are horrible.</p>
<p>Conclusion? Economic nationalism is a lie, which hides behind vague
communication, cherry picking examples (e.g., the decent source lists only
historical success stories neglecting essential "how" and "why" questions; the
same problem is even worse in other sources),
conspiracy theories and flawed logic in both economic and philosophical
sense. Economic nationalists do not care about microeconomics
(welfare of the individual people), they care only about macroeconomics (welfare
of nation (whatever that means to them)). Thus economic nationalism does not
solve microeconomic problems it claims to solve (mainly economic inequality).
Furthermore because economic nationalist only care about their own
macroeconomics, this raises tensions with other nations. And as history shows
us this could result in war.</p>
