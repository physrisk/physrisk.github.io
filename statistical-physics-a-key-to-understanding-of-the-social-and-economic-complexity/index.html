        <p>Originally I have written
this article back in the end of 2013 and submitted it to a pop-science
article contest organized by three locally well-known pop-science blogs
"<a href="https://www.mokslosriuba.lt">Mokslo sriuba</a>" (en. Science soup; online
pop-science web-show), technologijos.lt (edit:
currently defunct general science news portal) and
<a href="https://www.konstanta.lt">konstanta.lt</a> (en. constant; very popular blog
dedicated to astronomy and astrophysics). The article was rather
successful and won the scientific jury prize in the contest!</p>
<p>Now, after the contest has ended, I can publish this article (and its
English translation) on "Physics of Risk". So I invite you to read
on!</p>

<p>Imagine - you are currently in the theater. You have just seen a play.
While it wasn't that bad, it still wasn't that good. Still somebody have
surely enjoyed it! A girl couple of rows below you stood up and started
claping (loudly and intensively). What happens next? She looks at a boy
sitting near her and says something to him. Whatever she said, it worked
like a charm as the boy also stands up and starts clapping (though not
so loudly nor intensively). Some people notice the couple and decide
that the play wasn't that bad, so they also start claping. People who
came with the people already clapping start feeling uncomfortable - are
they less profound than their peers? Clearly no, so they also start
claping. In few moments time all viewers, and you too, are claping as if
the play was truly magnificient! Why? This question I'll attempt to
answer by providing you more and diverse examples. But let met start
with a brief historical retrospective.</p>
<p>By the middle of XIXth century physicists already knew ideal gas laws.
But the laws were known from the experiments, but were not explained
theoretically. Theoretical explanation was proposed by James Clerk
Maxwell (1831-1879) and Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (1844-1906), which
proposed kinetic theory of gasses. At the core of this theory was
cutting-edge novelty in physics - a simple idea that individual
trajectories of each particle does not matter and that the only
important thing is common properties of their collisions. These
commonalities were described and taken into account by using statistics
framework, which was started to develop in the works by the pioneers of
sociology, such as Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874), Auguste Comte
(1798-1857) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873). In sociology this
framework was used to described common properties of human societies.
This is well reflected by Boltzmann, who noted that "molecules are like
so many individuals, having the most various states of motion" while
formulating the founding principles of statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>In order to be able to use statistical framework to its full extent one
needs to have large amounts of data. The collection of economic and
social data in XIXth century was quite problematic as the experiments
with humans were practically impossible and there was no way to
conveniently and reliably collect and store high-resolution real-world
data. So the social scientists had to adapt their way of "doing" science
- they had to rely more on the general ideas than on the data. In this
context an image of rational, with only <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2011/03/30/with-notably-rare-exceptions/">notably rare
exceptions</a>,
society (economy, market, etc.) was developed. Interestingly enough
despite intense critique by the social scientists themselves this image
is still alive and kicking today.</p>
<p>Physicists on the other hand were able to conduct experiments as much as
they needed, and thus statistical physics marched at the full speed
ahead. Soon after the development of the kinetic theory, it was used by
Albert Einstein and Marian Smoluchowski (1872-1917) to prove the
existence of atoms. A few decades latter Ernst Ising (1900-1998)
proposed an elementary model to explain ferromagnetism. <a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/ising-model/">Ising
model</a> is especially
interesting due to exhibiting emergence of orderly structures.
Furthermore by the middle of XX-th century physicists started to notice
other inanimate systems, which exhibited emergence of orderly structure.
These structures were something very fascinating, because they were
found to emerge from the interactions between the particles rather than
being an intrinsic part of the particles themselves.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Emergence of orderly structure in the Ising
model." id="attachment_2595" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2014/ideo-izingo-imagnetejimas.jpg" title="Emergence of orderly structure in the Ising
model."/> <span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 1:</span><span class="caption-text">Emergence of orderly structure in the Ising model. On the left we show initial disorder, while on the write we see how the same spin domains (structures) are forming. Here distinct colors represent particles with magnetic spins pointing up or down. Illustration obtained by using applet available on</span></span></div>
<p>An excellent example of the spontaneous emergence of structures is the
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/belousov-zhabotinsky-reaction/">Belousov-Zhabotinsky</a>
reaction. Chemical reagents are added to the medium in which they mix
and react. In further reactions participate not only the initial
reagents, but also the products of previous reactions. As the reagents
may have different colorings, the color of the medium also changes in
time and space.</p>

<p>Similar patterns and phenomena may be observed in living systems. For
example each autumn we can observe birds flocking together and going
south. Then the flock is moving it appears that each separate individual
is moving erratically, but while flock stays united and is able to fly
in a definite direction. Social patterns may be observed all year round
- one just needs to find a popular pedestrian alley or square. People
movement on an individual scale will be inherently erratic, but people
on a global scale will form lanes and move in structured manner.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Two examples of social
structures." id="attachment_2596" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2014/ideo-strukturu-formavimasis-society.jpg" title="Two examples of social
structures."/> <span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 2:</span><span class="caption-text">Two examples of emerging social structures: pedestrian alley and intersecting pedestrian flows. Both illustrations taken from prof. dr.  D. Helbing talk 'Pedestrians, Crowds, Disasters, and the Role of Self-Organization.'</span></span></div>
<p>In the illustration above you can see two examples. On the left - photo
of pedestrian alley and a diagram of people movement directions. Note
that people moving in the same direction frequently form groups. In this
way "traffic lanes" spontaneously emerge. Second example is on the right
and here we see two intersecting pedestrian flows. The top figure shows
theoretical prediction, while the bottom - result obtained in numerical
simulation. Similar patterns may be observed in the most busy and
complex road crossings, which also have diagonal lanes (such road
crossings may be found in the largest cities - Tokyo, London, New York,
etc.).</p>
<p>Structures also form as a result of our social life. In previous century
it was noted that social interactions may be visualized as graph. Graph
- is a mathematical object, which is composed of nodes (dots in the
figure below), in social context - individuals, and edges (lines in the
figure below), in social context - existing social relationship (e.g.,
family ties, friendship, being acquaintances or co-workers). Social
graphs are frequently referred to as social networks or simply networks.
Thus in science this term appeared earlier than <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Google+</em> or
other social networking websites were created. Though contemporary
scientists frequently use the data from these websites in their
contemporary research.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Two networks - left one was generated by using Erdos-Renyi algorithm,
right one was generated by using Barabasi-Albert
algorithm." id="attachment_2597" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2014/ideo-socialinis-tinklas.jpg" title="Two networks - left one was generated by using Erdos-Renyi algorithm,
right one was generated by using Barabasi-Albert
algorithm."/> <span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 3:</span><span class="caption-text">Two networks: left one was generated by using Erdos-Renyi algorithm, right one was generated by using Barabasi-Albert algorithm. Illustration was obtained by using applets from other articles on Physics of Risk.</span></span></div>
<p>In the figure above you can see two distinct networks. Network on the
left was generated by assuming that social interactions (represented by
the edges) between individuals (nodes) form randomly. In such network
most nodes have similar number of edges connected to them (node degree).
In contrast, nodes of network on the right have very broad distribution
of degrees - there are relatively many nodes with small degree and also
relatively many nodes with large degree. Similar patterns are observed
in actual social networks - there are many people who are comparatively
socially inactive, while there also unbelievably many individuals who
are very socially active.</p>
<p>Social structures emerge not only in the spatial dimension, but also in
time domain. E.g., in the financial markets periods large trading
activity (price variation) are followed by the periods low trading
activity. Similar dynamics was observed, while registering internet
traffic flow, number of emails sent from the server, number of sms sent
and calls made in the mobile operator networks and also appearance of
messages <em>Twitter</em>. Classical theories from social sciences tend to
related these observations to the external information flows. But let us
recall previous examples - does some policeman regulate traffic in the
pedestrian alley? Does somebody force you to select one friends over the
others? Does somebody "color" the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction? No.
Thus external information, or more generally external influence, is not
necessary for social structures to emerge - structures may be formed
simply due to intrinsic social interactions.</p>
<p>Same phenomenon is also behind the events in theater, which we discussed
in the opening paragraph. Human interactions made the mediocre play into
a hit.</p>
<p>The aim of this article was to review variety of emerging social
structures and also to show that essentially similar phenomena are
observed both in the living and inanimate complex systems. Contemporary
understanding of inanimate complex is already well developed. These
ideas may be further used to gain insights into the living complex
systems. Due to stochastic nature of socio-economic systems, ideas from
the statistical physics become of utmost importance. As the most of the
interesting questions in the field are asked about economics, one just
has to invent term "econophysics" as a sum of economics and physics.</p>
