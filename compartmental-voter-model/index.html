        <p>In <a href="/tag/sociology/">sociological</a> papers it is quite common to see the analysis
of how specific socio-demographic factors influence voting behavior. In
<a href="/tag/opinion-dynamics/">opinion dynamics</a> on the other hand we are usually
interested only in contagion effects. Though some of the models sometimes are
more sophisticated and include things like
<a href="/tag/bounded-confidence/">bounded confidence</a>, <a href="/tag/networks/">explicit</a>
or implicit (like in <a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/ishii-trust-suspicion-model/">Ishii's trust and suspicion
models</a>
we have recently discussed) network structure, which effectively segment the
society into separate groups. Yet these groups are surely not equivalent to the
socio-demographic groups.</p>

<p>Another issue is that often in <a href="/tag/opinion-dynamics/">opinion dynamics</a> the
data is not temporal, but is spatial instead. One way to avoid this problem is
to assume that electoral districts (our spatial dimension) are independent of
each other (we have implicitly made this assumption
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/many-state-herd-model-and-its-application-to-lithuanian-parliamentary-elections/">here</a>). Though obviously,
this assumption is not true. If you recall another
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/kawasaki-ising-model/">recent post</a>, then you likely
already know what we will do here. We will discuss an extension of the voter
model, which is similar to the discussed Kawasaki's idea about the
<a href="/tag/ising-model/">Ising model</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the model in question was published in
<span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Kononovicius2019Comp" title="A. Kononovicius. Compartmental voter model. Journal of Statistical Mechanics 2019: 103402 (2019). doi: 10.1088/1742-5468/ab409b. arXiv: 1906.01842 [physics.soc-ph].">1</a>]</span>. This post reuses some of the figures present
in the paper.</p>
<h2>The model</h2>
<p>We will assume that there are \( N \) agents, each of which is in one of
\( T \) states. These states can correspond to opinions or to
socio-demographic types (hence the notation). Similarly to the spins in the
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/kawasaki-ising-model/">Kawasaki's Ising model</a>, the
states of the agents in this model are also assumed to be fixed. Instead the
agents are able to move between \( M \) compartments as long as the
compartments are not overcrowded (they are assume to have inherent capacity
\( C \)).</p>
<p>Let us assume that the movements between compartments are based on homophily.
With the actual rule inspired by the
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/voter-model/">original voter model</a>. Given
different source and destination compartments, \( i \neq j \), and that
the destination compartment is not over its capacity, \( N_j &lt; C \), the
transition rate is assumed to be:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\left(k\right)}^{i\rightarrow j} = X_{i}^{\left(k\right)}\left(\varepsilon^{\left(k\right)}+X_{j}^{\left(k\right)}\right) .
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Otherwise the transition rate is equal to zero. In the above
\( X_i^{(k)} \) is the number of type \( k \) agents in the
district \( i \), \( \varepsilon^{(k)} \) is the individual transition
rate for type \( k \), \( N_j \) is total number of agents in the
district \( j \).</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Schema of the compartmental voter model." src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2020/cvm-schema.png" title="Schema of the compartmental voter model."/><span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 1:</span><span class="caption-text">Schema of the compartmental voter model. Arrows show directions of possible transitions along with respective transition rates. Note that zero rate means that this transitions will not happen unless something changes. Parameters: N = 20, T=2, M=5, C=5, ε=2.</span></span></div>
<p>Note that the compartmental voter model is conceptually similar to the
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/schellings-segregation-model/">original Schelling's model</a>
as well. Yet we implement a continuous transition rule instead of discrete one.
This allows us to implement the compartmental voter model in continuous time.</p>
<h2>Dynamics</h2>
<p>Sadly, the model can be studied analytically only if the capacity is effectively
infinite, \( C = N \). If so, then we can write total entry and exit rates
for the compartments. Otherwise, if \( C &lt; N \), the total entry and exit
rates do not have closed forms. Furthermore the analytical results apply only to
the stationary probability density functions and not to the compartmental
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/rank-size-distribution-and-uk-census-2011-data-set/">rank-size distributions</a>
in which we are interested in.</p>
<p>For the infinite capacity case it can be easily shown that the stationary
distribution is Beta distribution, or for finite \( N \) it is Beta-binomial
distribution instead.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black): N=3000, T=1, M=100 and C=N (both), ε=2 (a) and 0.03 (b)." src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2020/cvm-jstat-fig1.png" title="Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black): N=3000, T=1, M=100 and C=N (both), ε=2 (a) and 0.03 (b)."/><span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 2:</span><span class="caption-text">Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black): N=3000, T=1, M=100 and C=N (both), ε=2 (a) and 0.03 (b).</span></span></div>
<p>Yet interestingly the same fit also applies to the compartmental rank-size
distribution.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black) with the same parameters as in the previous figure." src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2020/cvm-jstat-fig2.png" title="Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black) with the same parameters as in the previous figure."/><span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 3:</span><span class="caption-text">Model (red) vs Beta-fit (black) with the same parameters as in the previous figure</span></span></div>
<p>Note that there is an essential difference between how we calculate stationary
and compartmental distributions. Stationary distributions are obtained by
observing the model over time at fixed spatial unit (as the model is ergodic,
this approach is equivalent to observing an ensemble), while compartmental
distributions are obtained by observing the model over space at fixed time.
They do not need to match, yet they do.</p>
<h2>Interactive app</h2>
<p>Meanwhile we invite you to explore interactive app, which implements the
compartmental voter model. Though there are few restrictions.</p>
<p>First of all note that in this app has fixed \( T \) to be \( 1 \).
Allowing for a flexible number of the agent types would make user interface
more complex than it is currently necessary. Having \( T&gt;1 \) does somewhat
change dynamics of the model, but only if \( C &lt; N \). Because different
agent types interact only via finite capacity.</p>
<p>Also we have fixed \( M \) to be \( 100 \). While this choice is not
that necessary, but it doesn't limit the user a lot as \( M \) doesn't have
huge impact on the observed dynamics of the model. Having it at \( 100 \)
is optimal, because the simulation is still not that resource intensive, but we
can also see pattern in the rank-size distribution.</p>
<p>Note that in this app you specify not the total number of agents, \( N \),
but \( X_i(0) \), which corresponds to the number of agents in any given
compartment \( i \) at time \( t = 0 \). Therefore initial spatial
distribution of the agents is uniform over compartments.</p>
<p>Note that if \( C &lt; N_i(0) \cdot M \), you can change the fitting 
parameters, \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). Otherwise they are set
automatically to values obtained during analytical derivation of the stationary
distribution.</p>
<p>Finally, allow some time for the stationary distribution, which is obtained
from the first compartment time series, to converge. It does take some time as
well as enough data points are needed for the probability density function to
start look smoother.</p>
<p>So feel free to explore the model using the app below. Note that in a few weeks
time, with new posts on this same model, we will add a few apps more.</p>
