        <p>Over the last few posts I have been writing about variety of research
conducted by a <a href="/tag/catania-group/">group based in University of Catania</a>.
I have covered some of their models illustrating various often
counter-intuitive effects of randomness within social systems. This time let
us talk about how a certain degree of randomness could benefit our political
life <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Pluchino2011PhysA" title="A. Pluchino, C. Garofalo, A. Rapisarda, S. Spagano, M. Caserta. Accidental Politicians: How Randomly Selected Legislators Can Improve Parliament Efficiency.

<h2>Model</h2>
<p>In accidental politicians model <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Pluchino2011PhysA" title="A. Pluchino, C. Garofalo, A. Rapisarda, S. Spagano, M. Caserta. Accidental Politicians: How Randomly Selected Legislators Can Improve Parliament Efficiency. Physica A 390: 3944-3954 (2011). doi: 10.1016/j.physa.2011.06.028. arXiv:1103.1224 [physics.soc-ph].">1</a>]</span> the aim is to
simulate effectiveness of legislatures under different scenarios. Each
legislature is composed from \( N \) politicians (we use \( N = 141
\), because this is the number of politicians in Lithuanian parliament).
Some of the politicians are independent, \( N_{ind} \), while the
others are split between majority and minority parties or coalitions (the
proportion is set by model parameter \( \rho_{maj} \).</p>
<h3>Setting up legislature</h3>
<p>Each politician is characterized by their party affiliation (or lack of
thereof), and by their position on personal-social gain graph. Position of
independent politicians is set completely randomly (both coordinates are
sampled uniformly from \( [-1, 1] \) value range, i.e., from \(
\mathcal{U}(-1,1) \)), while affiliated politicians must be within the
range of values tolerated by their party (i.e., at most \( r_{tol} \)
from the party "ideal"). In the app below, parties are shown as big blue
(majority) and red (minority) circles (the size of the circles indicates the
range of tolerance, while the center coincides with the party "ideal").
Likewise affiliated politicians are shown as blue and green squares, which
appear strictly within the circles.  Independent politicians are shown as
black squares, and they may be located anywhere on the personal-social gain
graph.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Freshly generated

legislature"/><span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 1:</span><span class="caption-text">Freshly generated legislature. Small squares represent politicians, big circles - majority and minority parties. Horizontal axis is the personal gain axis. Vertical axis is the social gain axis.</span></span></div>
<h3>Enacting laws</h3>
<p>To simplify the presentation we have add additional parameter \( N_L
\), which set the number of laws each legislature will vote on. After
\( N_L \) laws have been voted on, a new election will occur and new
politicians will be generated. In the app below we use \( N_L = 100 \),
as this is large enough number to see what each particular legislature is
about, and it is also small enough for quick simulation.</p>
<p>Law proposals are submitted by randomly selected politicians. Each proposal
inherits social gain value of the proposer. Party affiliation of the
proposer is also recorded. Members of the same party will always vote for
a proposal submitted by their colleague. Members of the other party and
independents will check the proposal a bit more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Member of the other party will vote for the proposal, if the social gain
value of the proposal is greater than or equal to their party's "ideal"
social gain, \( y \geq y_{id} \), and if they perceive that the
personal gain is also greater than or equal to their party's "ideal", \(
x_{id} \). Perception is implemented by randomizing proposal's personal
gain coordinate, \( x^{\ast} \sim \mathcal{U}(-1, 1) \), for every
politician. Thus the second condition would be \( x^{\ast} \geq x_{id}
\). In other words, if social gain of the proposal is sufficiently high, a
politician belonging to the other party will vote for the proposal with
probability equal to \( \frac{x_{id} + 1}{2} \).</p>
<p>If the proposer was an independent, then all affiliated politicians would
vote following this logic.</p>
<p>Independents ignore the party affiliation of the proposer. They always
consider social gain and personal gain of the proposal using the logic
outlined above. Though instead of using party "ideal" as a reference, they
use their own coordinates.</p>
<p>The law is enacted if half or more of the politicians vote for it. If it is
enacted, its social gain is added to the overall social welfare.
Mathematically, we could track parliament history by storing voting outcomes
as \( S_k \) (0 - failed vote, 1 - successful vote) and recording
social gain values of the proposals as \( y_k \). Social welfare is
then given by</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
W_k = \sum_{i=0}^{k} S_i y_i .
\end{equation}</p>
<p>For mathematical simplicity let us agree that \( W_{-1} = 0 \).</p>
<h3>Example proposal</h3>
<p>As an example let us consider the picture in the figure below. Proposer was
randomly selected to be a member of the minority (red) party. Proposer is
highlighted by a green circle. They are close to their party's "ideal", but
the proposal inherits coordinates of the individual proposer.</p>
<div class="figure"><img alt="Considering
proposal" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/2025/accidental-politicians-proposal.png" title="Considering
proposal"/><span class="caption"><span class="caption-prefix">Fig. 2:</span><span class="caption-text">How a law proposal is being considered. Green circle corresponds to the coordinates of the proposer, while green lines help us estimate the coordiantes on the horizontal and vertical axes. Blue rectangle shows shared consideration window of the members of the minority party. Gray rectangle shows consideration window of an independent politician.</span></span></div>
<p>As the proposer is from the minority party, all the representatives of this
paper will vote for the proposer.</p>
<p>Representatives of the majority (blue) party will not support this law,
because social gain score of this proposal (which is in fact negative) is
less than their "ideal" social gain, i.e., we have \( y &lt; y_{id} \).</p>
<p>Independents will consider voting for the proposal only if the proposal's
social gain score is greater than their own "ideal" social gain, i.e., \(
y \geq y_{id} \). In this particular case, it is obvious that for most
independents this condition does not hold, but it holds for the independent
politician whom we have decided to highlight. Their consideration window is
shown as gray rectangle. Notably, it is not necessary for the proposer to
come from the consideration window, at this point it sufficient that social
gain score of the proposal is greater than the independents expectation.
Now, we would randomize personal gain (horizontal) coordinate of the
proposal. If after this randomization the proposal remains in the
consideration window, then the politician would vote to enact the proposal.
Though as we can see in this particular case there is roughly \( 50\% \)
chance of this happening.</p>
<p>In the simulation this proposal was not passed. Mostly because it was
rejected by the majority's party's members, but also because of its low
social gain score prevented independents to seriously consider it.</p>
<h3>Calculating efficiency</h3>
<p>So, after the law is enacted, its social gain is added to the social
welfare. We could say that the most effective legislature is the one which
increases social welfare the fastest. So it is natural to define efficiency
as average social gain gained per proposal during the legislature.
Mathematically efficiency of \( j \)-th legislature is given by</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E_j = \frac{W_{(j+1) N_L - 1} - W_{j N_L - 1}}{N_L}
= \frac{1}{N_L} \sum_{i=0}^{N_L-1} S_{j N_L + i} y_{j N_L + i} .
\end{equation}</p>
<p>In the above \( S_k \) is the success indicator of \( k \)-th
proposal (this index spans across legislatures). Similarly, \( y_k \)
is social gain value of the \( k \)-th proposal.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I will not show lots of figures in this post, you can reproduce relevant
points yourselves. Here instead, I'll just repeat the main conclusion of
<span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Pluchino2011PhysA" title="A. Pluchino, C. Garofalo, A. Rapisarda, S. Spagano, M. Caserta. Accidental Politicians: How Randomly Selected Legislators Can Improve Parliament Efficiency. Physica A 390: 3944-3954 (2011). doi: 10.1016/j.physa.2011.06.028. arXiv:1103.1224 [physics.soc-ph].">1</a>]</span>. There is an optimal number of independent
politicians,</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
N^{\ast}_{ind} \approx \frac{4 N \rho_{maj} - 2 N - 4}{4 \rho_{maj} - 1} .
\end{equation}</p>
<p>With this number of independent politicians the expected (or mean observed)
efficiency of the legislature will be maximized. As far as I have tested,
this result is well reproduced by the interactive app below.</p>
<p>With \( N = 141 \) and \( \rho_{maj} = 0.6 \) the optimal number of
independents is between 37 and 38. As \( \rho_{maj} \) increases, then
more independents are needed to reach optimal efficiency.</p>
<h2>Interactive app</h2>
<p>This app has quite a few graphs and plots. The descriptions below the app
are helpful, so I would advise to look through them before proceeding to
your own experimentation.</p>
<iframe class="html5-embed html5-embed-iframe" src="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/uploads/models/stats/models/accidental-politicians/index.html" style="height: 730px; width: 520px" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
<p>On the top-most row you will see average efficiency over all legislatures
during the current simulation. Number of previously simulated legislatures
is also provided for your interest.</p>
<p>In the top-left you can see the snapshot of the current legislature. If you
decide to go slower, the last proposer would also be highlighted.
Identically as in the figures above.</p>
<p>In the top-right you can see the efficiency-acceptance graph. The dots there
show the average legislature efficiency conditioned on the observed
acceptance for that legislature. The lines indicate how spread out the
efficiency was with that acceptance.</p>
<p>The mid-row contains two frequency plots. They provide detailed information
on how relatively often given efficiency and acceptance values were
observed.</p>
<p>The bottom-row contains social welfare, \( W \), time series plot. It
will show just the last \( N_L \) values. If you go at the top speed,
you will see just the time series for the last legislature.</p>
<p>In the button-row there is an additional button, which allows the app user
to switch between three distinct speeds (100 proposals per second, 400
proposals per second, 2000 proposals per second). The text on the button
indicates the speed you could presently switch to.</p><h2>References</h2><ul class="article-references"><li id="Pluchino2011PhysA">A. Pluchino, C. Garofalo, A. Rapisarda, S. Spagano, M. Caserta.
