based</a>
and
<a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/stochastic-ant-colony-model/">stochastic</a>
model of ant colony), which is an interesting example of applying
knowledge obtained from one field to another. Human (ex., trader in the
financial markets) crowd behavior is ideologically quite similar to the
behavior in ant colonies, thus the success and relevancy of the
aforementioned model were to be expected. Though the key to success lies
in the description of large number of entities.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough one can also create, and thus provide additional
backing for the argument above, a successful model for human crowd
behavior using classical models of statistical physics as an
inspiration. In this text we will discuss agent-based spin model of the
financial markets proposed by Bornholdt <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Bornholdt2001IJMPC" title="S. Bornholdt.

Physica A 316: 441-452 (2002).">4</a>]</span>, which is based on widely known <a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/ising-model/">Ising
model</a>.
Despite the fact that Ising model models inanimate system, natural
interactions are introduced by assuming two different types of
interactions between the agents - local herding (local feromagnetic
interaction) and global minority game (coupling with total magnetic
field generated by whole lattice).</p>
<p>Bornholdt's model is also interesting as recently there were some
attempts to propose macro treatment of the original agent-based model
<span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Krause2011DPGVerh" title="S. M. Krause, S. Bornholdt. Spin models as microfoundation of macroscopic financial market models. 2011. arXiv: 1103.5345 [q-fin.PR].">5</a>]</span>. Previously similar thing was done with
Kirman's model <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Alfarano2005CompEco" title="S. Alfarano, T. Lux, F. Wagner. Estimation of Agent-Based Models: The Case of an Asymmetric Herding Model. Computational Economics 26: 19-49 (2005).">2</a>]</span>.</p>

<h2>Bornholdt's modifications of Ising model</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://rf.mokslasplius.lt/ising-model/">the previous
text</a>
on Ising model we have already mentioned that Ising model can be applied
towards human crowd behavior modeling. One just have to imagine that
each particle within the grid is agent representing some subject in the
modeled system (ex., human). In such case the spin of particle can be
interpreted as agent's decision or opinion towards some question. As in
the financial markets agents choose to buy or to sell stock - we can use
simplest case (with spins point either up or down) of Ising model when
applying it towards the financial markets.</p>
<p>The above analogy is very general, while Ising model has a lot of
variations and interpretations, thus technical details about the actual
models might differ by a lot. One of the most essential technical
details is how agents make their decisions. In the Bornholdt's model
agents are polled asynchronously using heat bath formalism. Meaning that
randomly chosen particles are allowed to achieve thermal equilibrium
while being in contact with a heat bath, whose temperature \(  T\sim \frac{1}{\beta}  \). Particle state, or alternatively agent
decision, after polling statistically (Boltzmann distribution is used)
depends on the energy of the state:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 p_{S_i(t+1) = 1} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-2 \beta h_i(t))}\,,\quad p_{S_i(t+1) = -1} = 1-p_{S_i(t+1) = 1}\,,
\end{equation}</p>
<p>here \(  h_i(t) \) is local magnetic field acting on particle <em>i</em>.
Note that the above probabilities were simplified by using the fact that
possible \(  S_i(t+1) \) values are restricted to +1 and -1, and
that \(  Z = \exp[-\beta h_i(t) S_i(t+1)]+\exp[\beta h_i(t) S_i(t+1)] \). Due to the first simplification it might appear
that probabilities do not depend on the energy, the product of \( h_i(t) \) and \(  S_i(t) \), while it should be noted that formally
dependence persists.</p>
<p>Note that the time tick in the probabilities above is not the time tick
used in applets figures. 6400 of spin flips (time ticks in the
probabilities above) correspond to the single time tick in applet
figures. Number 6400 is selected due to the number of agents in the grid
(80x80).</p>
<p>In the simplest case of Ising model local magnetic field is created by
the neighboring particles and the external magnetic field. In
Bornholdt's model interaction with the neighboring particles is
retained, but there is no external magnetic field. Instead particles
interact with global magnetic field, which is created by all particles
inside the grid. Thus in Bornholdt's model local magnetic field is be
expressed as:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 h_i(t) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^N J_{ij} S_j(t) - \alpha C_i(t) \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{j=1}^N S_j(t) ,
\end{equation}</p>
<p>here \(  N \) is a number of particles in the grid, \(  J_{ij} \) - strength of local interaction between two particles (\( J_{ij} = 1  \) if particles <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are neighbors, o otherwise
constant equals zero), \(  \alpha \) - strength of global
interaction, \(  C_i(t) \) defines if global interaction is
antiferromagnetic, \(  C_i(t) = 1 \), or ferromagnetic, \( C_i(t) = -1 \). These modifications and heterogeneity of agents, \( C_i(t) \), are required in order to introduce two mechanics - minority
game and herding instinct - very common in agent-based model of the
financial markets <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Cristelli2012Fermi" title="M. Cristelli, L. Pietronero, A. Zaccaria. Critical Overview of Agent-Based Models for Economics. Proceedings of the School of Physics 'E. Fermi', Course CLXXVI, ed. F. Mallnace, H. E. Stanley, pp. 235-282. SIF-IOS, Bologna-Amsterdam, 2012. doi: 10.3254/978-1-61499-071-0-235.">6</a>]</span>. Transition of
\(  C_i(t) \) are defined according:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 C_i(t+1) = -C_i(t) , \quad \text{if} \quad \alpha C_i(t)S_i(t) \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{j=1}^N S_j(t) &lt; 0 . 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Briefly (for detailed explanation see <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Bornholdt2001IJMPC" title="S. Bornholdt. Expectation bubbles in a spin model of markets: Intermittency from frustration across scales. International Journal of Modern Physics C 12: 667-674 (2001).">3</a>]</span>)
the above scenario can be summarized as: agents in minority might panic
and start to imitate majority (due to herding instinct), while agents in
majority might see a possibility of making profit if they would join
minority (one might draw analogy with the minority game). Thus one can
simplify the expression of local magnetic field to</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 h_i(t) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^N J_{ij} S_j(t) - \alpha\left| M(t) \right|,
\end{equation}</p>
<p>here \(  M(t) \) is average particle magnetization. In <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Kaizoji2002PhysA" title="T. Kaizoji, S. Bornholdt, Y. Fujiwara. Dynamics of price and trading volume in a spin model of stock markets with heterogeneous agents. Physica A 316: 441-452 (2002).">4</a>]</span> it is assumed that this scenario describes
behavior of chartist traders - those who optimistically or
pessimistically follow global trends. While there is also a third kind
of agents who are placed outside the grid.</p>
<p>Fundamentalists are assumed to be those agents outside the grid. They
tend to become more active then the difference between fundamental value
(which can be seen as "true" value) and actual price (which can be seen
as "perceived" value) becomes large. As they expect that market will
stabilize - price will move towards fundamental value. Thus
fundamentalists sell if the price is larger than fundamental value
(stock is overrated) and buy if the price is smaller (stock is
underrated). Therefore they limit chartists' speculations and disallow
large enormous deviations of price from the fundamental value (which can
be seen as speculative bubbles).</p>
<h2>Introducing price and volume</h2>
<p>If there are \(  m \) fundamentalists in the market and their
influence equals \(  a \), then this group creates excess demand,
which equals:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 ED_f (t)= a m \ln \frac{P_f(t)}{P(t)} . 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Evidently chartist excess demands is dependent on magnetization of the
grid:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 ED_c (t) = b N M(t) , 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>here \(  b \) is chartist influence on the market.</p>
<p>By assuming that trades occur through the market maker, who sets correct
prices by balancing demands (original Walras scenario), one can
obtain</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 ED_f (t) + ED_c (t) = a m \ln \frac{P_f(t)}{P(t)} + b NM(t) = 0. 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>From the above expression one can defined log-price of the stock:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 \ln P(t) = \ln P_f(t) + \frac{b N}{a m} M(t) . 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>And in such case return:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
 r(t, \Delta t) = \ln P(t) - \ln P(t-\Delta t) = \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t} \xi(t) + \frac{b N}{a m} \left[M(t) - M(t-\Delta t) \right] , 
\end{equation}</p>
<p>here \(  \sigma \) is variability of fundamental value and \( \xi(t) \) is Gaussian random variable (unit variance, zero mean). If
\(  \sigma \) is small, then one will observe typical statistical
properties of return - power law distribution of returns and
clustering of volatility. Otherwise dynamics of the market will be
overwhelmed by the changes of fundamental value - market will act
according to the efficient market hypothesis (one will observe Gaussian
distribution and White noise spectral density).</p>
<p>Under the assumption of market maker clearing the market one can also
obtain expression of market volume. Note that if grid is not magnetized
then price equals fundamental price, thus fundamentalists do not
generate any demand. Though chartists also generate no excess demand in
such case, yet both chartist groups generate their demands (as they are
equal excess demand remains equal to zero). From Walras scenario
follows that if magnetization is non-zero fundamentalists are forced by
the market maker to make deals with the chartists, who were unable to
make trades with other chartists. Therefore total amount of trade equals
number of chartists in the majority group - some of them make trades
with minority chartists, some trade with fundamentalists. By putting the
above words into math one can express volume <span class="article-cite-items">[<a class="article-cite-item" href="#Kaizoji2002PhysA" title="T. Kaizoji, S. Bornholdt, Y. Fujiwara.

<p>\begin{equation}
 v(t) = \frac{V(t)}{N} = b \frac{1 + \left| M(t) \right|}{2}.
